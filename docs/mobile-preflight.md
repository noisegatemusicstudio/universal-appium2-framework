# Offline mobile setup preflight

This standalone diagnostic implements [RRDMOBILE-9](https://noisegatemusicstudios.atlassian.net/browse/RRDMOBILE-9).
It does not import WDIO configuration, load `.env`, start Appium, install tools,
contact devices, create sessions, use AI, or contact central/customer services.
RRDMOBILE-8 and real-device execution remain separate and **NOT VERIFIED**.

## Command

Use a supported Node workspace (Node >=22.19.0) with its locked dependencies already
installed. Dependency installation is a separate, explicitly authorized setup step;
preflight never installs anything.

```sh
npm run preflight:mobile -- --platform android --app-root <owned-directory> --app <relative-path.apk>
npm run preflight:mobile -- --platform ios --app-root <owned-directory> --app <relative-path.app>
npm run --silent preflight:mobile -- --platform android --app-root <owned-directory> --app <relative-path.apk> --json
```

Required flags: `--platform` (`android` or `ios`, exact lower case), `--app-root`
(explicit owned local directory), `--app` (path relative to that root, or an absolute
path inside it). Optional flag: `--json` (no value).
Only space-separated flags/values are accepted. Duplicate flags, positional values,
unknown flags, `--flag=value`, missing values, control characters and values longer
than 4096 characters fail; there is no environment/configuration fallback or guessed device.
The caller is responsible for selecting an owned root; filesystem permissions do
not establish organizational ownership.

The root is resolved against the current directory. Both lexical and canonical
containment must hold strictly inside the explicit root. Ordinary colon-containing
local names are accepted; `scheme://` prefixes and reserved `http:`, `https:`,
`ftp:`, `file:`, `smb:` and `data:` URI prefixes are rejected. Remote URLs, network
share paths, symlink escapes and missing paths fail. Android `.apk` must be a regular
file; iOS simulator `.app` must be a directory. Internal symlinks are allowed when
their canonical target stays inside the canonical root. Only `stat` and `realpath`
inspect the app: no contents, directory traversal, unpacking, hashes, signing,
installation or runtime validity checks. Symlinks/content can change after inspection;
this is a diagnostic, not a secure execution authorization.

The command reads only the repository's `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and
installed `package.json` metadata for Appium, WDIO CLI, TypeScript and tsx.
Metadata must be non-symlinked regular files (including their ancestor paths) of
at most 2 MB. Versions must be exact, supported
(Appium 3, WDIO 10, TypeScript >=5.9 <6, tsx 4), and agree across declared, locked
and installed metadata including lock-root declarations. Node must satisfy the
current repository engine contract `>=22.19.0`. The maintained `semver` parser
already in this locked dependency tree is reused; no packages are added or upgraded.
This is not an integrity audit of all transitive dependencies. macOS satisfies only
the iOS host prerequisite, not Xcode or simulator readiness.

## Reports and exits

Exit **0** means required offline inputs passed, never that mobile tests passed.
Exit **1** means at least one required check is invalid or unavailable.
Native tooling, installed drivers, device availability and application execution
always remain `not-checked` with `NOT_VERIFIED` and separate next actions.

JSON output is a single report (use npm `--silent` to suppress npm's own banner):
`schemaVersion: 1`, `evidence: "local-offline" | "test-only"`, `exitCode: 0 | 1`,
and `diagnostics`. Each diagnostic has `check`, `state`, `code`, `message`, and
`nextAction` strings. `state` is `verified` (this limited check passed), `invalid`
(a checked input failed), `unavailable` (a permitted observation could not complete),
or `not-checked` (no observation). Both renderers use bounded static messages,
without echoing paths, options, environment secrets or raw exceptions.
Injected library probes automatically label the whole report `test-only`; they
cannot certify a local workspace or any real device. There is no CLI probe override.

## Offline acceptance

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run test:preflight
```

These commands do not run WDIO. Tests use Node's official test runner with readable
Given/When/Then names; they do not require Cucumber's device runner. All app fixtures
are synthetic files/directories made in owned temporary roots and cleaned afterwards;
they are deliberately not installable applications.

The CLI harness spawns Node only to exercise the actual entrypoint. It loads the
existing tsx TypeScript launcher before arming test-only side-effect guards; launcher
initialization is tooling, not a preflight subprocess capability. Preflight itself
never spawns a subprocess. No device, emulator or Appium service runs. The guards
forbid network/service/process calls, filesystem writes and app-content reads
after initialization; static import review complements them.

For a red-to-green demonstration, deliberately remove the canonical containment
rejection in `checkApp`, run the S04 test by name, observe a nonzero test exit, then
restore that exact rule and rerun. Never leave the mutation in the committed tree.
Locked installation requires separate permission and a supported, clean dependency
workspace; do not substitute tooling or claim a blocked installation passed.
Done requires all seven offline criteria evidenced, independent review clear, and
the PR merged. Real-device execution remains explicitly unverified even then.
