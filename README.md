# Universal Mobile E2E Testing Template

A reusable starting point for native Android and iOS end-to-end tests using Appium 3, WebdriverIO 10, Cucumber, TypeScript, and Page Object Models. This is the single maintained framework implementation; it replaces the previous Appium 2 and Jest setup with WebdriverIO's official Cucumber runner integration.

It includes a generic app-launch smoke scenario. Product teams can add their app-specific features and Page Object Models without inheriting product-specific selectors or test data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.19 or newer and npm 10 or newer
- Android: Android SDK, a configured emulator or connected device, and a compatible Java Development Kit
- iOS: macOS with Xcode and an available simulator or connected device
- The app under test as an Android APK or iOS app bundle

Appium is installed as a project development dependency. Its platform drivers are managed using the Appium CLI.
Pinned npm overrides keep Appium's transitive `sharp` and `shell-quote` dependencies on patched releases; re-evaluate these overrides when upgrading Appium.

## Getting started

For read-only setup diagnostics, use the [offline mobile preflight](docs/mobile-preflight.md).
It never starts Appium or contacts a device; a successful result is not mobile readiness.

1. Install Node.js and dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm ci
   ```

2. Install the driver for the platform you will test:

   ```sh
   npm run appium:drivers:android
   ```

   Or, on macOS for iOS:

   ```sh
   npm run appium:drivers:ios
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the app path and device name for your platform. Keep app binaries and credentials out of source control.

4. Start an emulator or simulator, then run:

   ```sh
   npm run test:android
   ```

   Or:

   ```sh
   npm run test:ios
   ```

The local WebdriverIO Appium service starts and stops the Appium server for the test run. Appium drivers are installed once per development/CI environment, not on every test run.

```

## Page Object Model convention

Keep app-specific selectors and screen interactions in Page Object Models under `src/page-objects/`. Cucumber step definitions should express scenario behavior and delegate those interactions to the page objects. Prefer accessibility identifiers agreed with the app team; do not duplicate selectors in step definitions.

The included smoke scenario checks that Appium can retrieve a non-empty native view hierarchy after starting the app. It intentionally uses no product-specific selector. Replace or extend it with checks for your app's expected initial screen.

## Quality checks

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run test:preflight
```

GitHub Actions runs these checks for pushes and pull requests. Mobile E2E execution is platform- and app-dependent; add the app build or secure app download step for your product before wiring the test commands into CI.

## Reports

The WDIO spec reporter prints results in the console. The Allure reporter writes raw results to `allure-results/`, which is ignored by Git. Configure your CI or Allure tooling to publish and render those results as needed.

## AI-assisted authoring

The repository-level Copilot instructions provide conventions for AI-assisted scenario and Page Object Model authoring. Treat generated tests as drafts: verify selectors with the app team and run tests against the target app. AI is not part of the execution or pass/fail path.
